# Day 7 – Advanced DAX: Sales Performance Dashboard

## Overview
This repository contains the Power BI workbook and documentation for Day 7 of the Power BI course: Advanced DAX and Sales Performance Dashboard (MTD, QTD, YTD & Growth analysis).

## Files & Structure
- `pbix/Day7_AdvancedDAX.pbix` — final Power BI Desktop file
- `docs/Day1_notes.md` … `docs/Day7_notes.md` — daily notes and steps
- `dax/measures.md` — DAX measures (Total Sales, MTD, QTD, YTD, Previous Month Sales, Growth %)
- `images/` — screenshots of the dashboard and important steps (relationships, queries)
- `.gitignore` — ignored files
- `LICENSE` — license (optional)

## How to open
1. Download `Day7_AdvancedDAX.pbix` from `pbix/`.
2. Open with Power BI Desktop (latest version recommended).
3. Check `DimDate` table is marked as *Date table* and relationships are active: FactSales(OrderDate) -> DimDate(Date).
4. If measures show blank, ensure the `Date` column in `DimDate` is of type Date and the relationship is active.

## DAX measures (summary)
See `dax/measures.md` for full formulas:
- `Total Sales = SUM(FactSales[Sales])`
- `MTD Sales = CALCULATE([Total Sales], DATESMTD(DimDate[Date]))`
- `QTD Sales = CALCULATE([Total Sales], DATESQTD(DimDate[Date]))`
- `YTD Sales = CALCULATE([Total Sales], DATESYTD(DimDate[Date]))`
- `Previous Month Sales = CALCULATE([Total Sales], PREVIOUSMONTH(DimDate[Date]))`
- `Sales Growth % = DIVIDE([Total Sales]-[Previous Month Sales], [Previous Month Sales])`

## Notes & troubleshooting
- If KPIs are blank, check: relationship to `DimDate`, `DimDate[Date]` data type, date table marked as Date Table, and filter directions.
- For large `.pbix` file (> 50 MB), consider using Git LFS or uploading PBIX as a GitHub Release asset.
